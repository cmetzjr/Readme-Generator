# Quick README Generator
This is a command-line application that generates a README.md file in Markdown syntax. It uses Node's *inquirer module* to prompt the user with a series of questions, requesting information that's commonly included in README files. Once complete, Node's *fs module* will generate the README.md. <br>

## Installation
This is a NodeJS application, so Node must first be installed. Run `npm init` to install the dependencies. In the terminal, type `node index.js` to begin the sequence of prompts.

## Usage
The user will be prompted for the following information: Project title, Description of the project, URL where it's deployed, Installation instructions, Use instructions, Path (relative) to screenshot/screencast, Contribution guidelines, Tests conducted, Project license, GitHub username, repo URL, and owner's email address. After all of the prompts are complete, the user will receive a message that the README.md file was created. At this point, it's ready to be uploaded to the GitHub repo.
